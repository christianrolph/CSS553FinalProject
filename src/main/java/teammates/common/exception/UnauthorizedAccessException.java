     * in order to get the access (which should be unauthorized).
     * While it is true that there is little that user can do to elevate his/her privilege
     * even with that knowledge, we still need to do our part.

     * <p>There are, however, some cases whereby the error message would be legitimately helpful
     * to users, e.g. when submitting responses to a feedback session that has not opened yet.
     * For such cases, it is appropriate to set this flag as "true".
