# For dev server, this could be anything.
# For staging server, this must match the ID of the app your created on GAE.

# For staging/production server, this must match the region of your GAE application.

# This indicates whether task queues are active (e.g. items added to task queue will be queued for execution).

# In addition, during development mode, there is no "queueing", i.e. all tasks will be immediately executed.

# This is the Google Cloud Storage bucket name used by the app for production purposes, e.g. user profile pictures.
# For dev server, any name will do.
# For staging server, if you use the default bucket for your project, it should be <your app id>.appspot.com

# This is the secret key for communication between the site and reCAPTCHA.
